# OpenAPISpec -- Andrew D. Pitt

Individual portion instructions:
Design OpenApiSpec (YAML) for the action and the query that got assigned to you in the group assignment for JTBD.

Make sure:
Your OpenAPISpec YAML has no errors and it compiles with ReDoc
You have documented all inputs, outputs success and error responses. As well as examples properly rendered by ReDoc
Create a Docker container that runs Node (with alpine) has redoc-cli installed in it and renders your spec YAML file to html using the container, producing the rendered ReDoc html file when you run "make docs"
Submit the github URL of your work and make sure I have access
